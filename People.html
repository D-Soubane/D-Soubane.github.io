I am a first-year PhD student specializing in Physical and Chemical
Sciences, with a focus on advanced materials for renewable energy
applications. I hold a Master's degree in Teaching and Training
Professions in Physical and Chemical Sciences, where I studied the ab
initio properties of double perovskites. With a strong background in
condensed matter physics and quantum mechanics, I am passionate
about interdisciplinary research, combining theoretical and experimental
methods to optimize solar cell performance through innovative
approaches and computational simulations.simulations.

                <p> PHD THESIS OVERVIEW
Title: Exploration of Synergy Between Experimental
and Computational Approaches for Optimized
Energy Harvesting in DSSC Cells
Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) represent a promising
technology for harnessing solar energy due to their
relatively low cost, flexibility, and ability to operate under
low-light conditions. This PhD project aims to optimize
DSSCs
 by
 combining
 theoretical
 and
 experimental
approaches. By integrating DFT simulations conducted in
Morocco, via Quantum Espresso, with experimental work
in France focused on the synthesis and characterization of
prototypes, our research establishes a direct link between
computational predictions and the actual performance of
the devices, with the goal of improving the efficiency of
DSSCs.
