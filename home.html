        <h1>Welcome to the Home Page</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm currently an associate Professor at FPS-uca.ma.
 I have been in different Labs starting at Ensicaen in France later to university of Strasbourg then moved to Sherbrooke university before joining INRS-EMT and McGill univesity.
I earned my Ph.D. working on direct band gap semiconductors to fabricate the second generation of CIGS-based solar cells.
 During my stay in CNRS - Strasbourg university I worked on different nanostructures including graphene till 2008. My enginner diploma earned on experimental techniques for characterizing materials at uni-Strasbourg

My current research focuses on understanding the mechanisms of a memristor for A.I and using in the meantime DFT to unravel materials properties.  .</p>
