        <h1>Welcome to the Home Page</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm currently an associate Professor at FPS-uca.ma. I have been in different Labs strating on Ensicaen in France later to university of Strasbourg then moved to Sherbrooke univesity before coming to work at INRS-EMT and McGill univesity.
I earned my Ph.D. working on direct abnd gap semiconductors to fabricate the second gneration fo solar cells. During my stay in CNRS - Strasbourg university I worked on different nanostructure including graphene on 2008.

My current research focuses on understanding the mechanisms of a memristor for A.I and using in the meantime DFT to unravel materials properties.  .</p>
